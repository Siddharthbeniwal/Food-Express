# Food Express

Food Express is a dynamic food Ordering web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React JS, and Node.js), and integrated with Redux Toolkit for efficient and scalable state management. The app fetches the menu, including dishes details such as names, descriptions, prices, and images, from the backend, which retrieves this data from MongoDB. This flexible architecture ensures that future menu updates (like adding or removing items, modifying the descriptions, prices, or images) can be easily managed directly in the database, without requiring any code changes.

The application includes secure user authentication, with both sign-up and login functionality, protected by JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access. User data such as names and email addresses is stored securely in MongoDB, and passwords are securely encrypted using bcrypt to ensure user privacy.

To enhance usability, the application features a search functionality that enables users to quickly find their desired dishes by typing the dish name, making the ordering process faster and more efficient.

After adding items to the cart, users can review a detailed order summary before placing the order. This summary includes the names of the items, quantities, prices, and the total amount, ensuring a transparent and user-friendly checkout process. Additionally, users have convenient access to their order history, displayed in reverse chronological order, allowing them to effortlessly track and review previous purchases.
